Simple test of ChatGPT Spring code generating abilities.

Result: even on simpliest project with almost no functionalities, ChatGPT made mistakes. Pom file was missing dependency versions and xml version tag. The way ChatGPT instructed to add swagger produced generic null pointer exception errors (suspected dependency version mismatch, as the error was happening just from adding dependency?). It also didn't write a setter for one case in which it was used.

I can't imagine ChatGPT 3.5 being useful for anything but simplest syntax demonstration.
